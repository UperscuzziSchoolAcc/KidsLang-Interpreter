# KidsLang Interpreter
###### I created this as something to do in my spare time, and something to teach the children about code. This is definitely NOT Turing Complete. At least, not yet, but I dont plan to make it that way.

### Syntax
```
say hello
```
###### This will print hello, notice how quotes are not needed as everything is a string.
```
repeat 10
	say hello
end
```
###### This will print hello, 10 times
```
-- hello
```
###### 2 dashes create a single line comment, there are no multiline comments as of writing this.
```
make foo 64
```
###### The keyword "make" lets you declare a variable, this makes a variable named foo have the value of 64.
```
wait 5
```
###### Typing in "wait" and a number will wait that many seconds, this will work with variables as well.

###### As of now, the only way to open a file is to name it myCode.kl, and opening the .py file in the same directory. I plan to make it just a double click, to make it easier.
